	<p> This is my personal site. It is blank for now as I have not posted anything here yet. There may be more
		posted on this site later. For now you may see a link for my profile and you wish to contact me or view
		my work.</p>
	<h2>Profile</h2>
	<p>This will remain blank for now. I may post a concise view of my life's work and biography here in the future.
	</p>
	<h2>Find me on the web!</h2>
	<p>My main social media presence is on <a href="https://github.com/mrf-dot">GitHub</a>. If you wish to contact
		me directly the best way to do that is through my <a href="mailto:mfeigenbaum23@gmail.com">email</a>.
	</p>
	<p>This is some extra content on the website. It should be filled in eventually be extra code that you'll use to
		discuss various miscellaneous topics or anecdotes. The site shouldn't use too much JavaScript or CSS,
		as this only serves to distract, confuse, and anger the site viewer. Rather, the site should be simple,
		terse, and important.</p>
	<p>Only present the information and data that is needed. Don't include extra functionality to make it look
		modern, new, or complex. A simple site does not need such gimmicks in order to retain usership. Keep the
		user interface the same. Any major changes in the user interface that don't bring major improvements and
		easier usability will only decrease your viewership. They will also take longer to render in a browser,
		especially if you have a slow computer or internet connection. </p>
